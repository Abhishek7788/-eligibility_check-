# -eligibility_check-
This plugin checks student eligibility for a class based on their date of birth, class, and age. Users input these details, and the plugin determines eligibility. If eligible, the result appears in green with a "Yes" message; if not, it shows in red with "Not eligible." It provides quick and simple verification.
